                <span className="text-body m-3">
                    Key highlights:
                    <ul className="m-3">
                        <li>Developed a series of modular bridge designs that can be rapidly assembled, reducing construction time by 40% compared to traditional methods.</li>
                        <li>Pioneered the use of new, lightweight composite materials that offer enhanced strength and longevity, withstanding harsh environmental conditions.</li>
                        <li>Implemented environmentally friendly practices, including the use of recycled materials and reducing carbon emissions during the construction process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>

                <h3 className="fw-medium m-3">Impact and Recognition:</h3>

                <span className="text-body m-3">
                    The project received numerous accolades for its innovative approach to bridge engineering, including the Global Engineering Excellence Award. Our work not only set a new standard in bridge construction but also paved the way for sustainable engineering practices in large-scale infrastructure projects.
