                <span className="text-body m-3">
                    In 2019, I started my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Delaware.
                    Additionally, I was awarded a Research Assistantship under the direction of my research advisor Dr. Panagiotis Artemiadis.
                    For this degree, I excelled in 11 graduate-level course with a perfect GPA of 4.0, whilst passing the required Qualification and Candidancy Exams of the program.
                    Furthermore, I was awarded an embedded M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering.
