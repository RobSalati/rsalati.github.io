                <h2 className="fw-bold m-3">Diploma (B.Sc. & M.Sc.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2>

                I received my diploma degree (B.Sc. & M.Sc.) from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), in Greece, in 2019.

                During the first three years of my diploma studies, I explored the interdisciplinary curriculum of ECE, which equipped me with all the essential background to pursue any germane career.
                Later on, I was captivated by the fields of Automatic Control and Computer Science, which led me to major in Electronics and Systems, where I acquainted myself with Computer Systems, Signal Processing, Control System Design and, of course, Robotics.

                In the end, I graduated with the highest honors (9.02/10 - Top 5\%), after excelling in an extensive course load (64 courses in total), including four additional to my degree courses that further broadened my education.
                It should be noted that I ranked 18th among the 290 ECE graduates of 2019 (Top 6\%), while I was ranked 136th among the 250 ECE admitted students of 2013 (Top 55\%)

                    Through this collaboration, I decided to realize my master thesis ``Implementation of Quadruped Robot's Motion Control on SoC FPGA", in the context of a cooperation between the <a href="https://microlab.ntua.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{marginRight: '0px' }}> (MicroLab)</a> and the Control Systems Lab <a href="https://csl-ep.mech.ntua.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{marginRight: '0px' }}> (CSL-EP)</a>. Both of my supervisors, Prof. Dimitrios Soudris and Prof. Evangelos Papadopoulos \break inspired me to initiate a collaborative research between the two different scientific fields on a unprecedented venture.
