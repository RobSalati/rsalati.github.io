                , providing support in question resolving, as well as examining the students' assignments and comprehension of the theory lectured.

                    <br/><br/>
                Moreover, I was involved as an assistant in numerous events of the H2020 Project FabSpace 2.0, organized by MicroLab in the National Technical University of Athens.
